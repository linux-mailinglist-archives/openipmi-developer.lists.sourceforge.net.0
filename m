Good question. I wonder if Baoquan knows about problems caused by the
particular notifiers that will end up in the hypervisor list. Note
that there will be some shuffles and the list will be slightly
different in V2.

Anyway, I see four possible solutions:

  1. The most conservative approach is to keep the current behavior
     and call kdump first by default.

  2. A medium conservative approach to change the default default
     behavior and call hypervisor and eventually the info notifiers
     before kdump. There still would be the possibility to call kdump
     first by the command line parameter.

  3. Remove the possibility to call kdump first completely. It would
     assume that all the notifiers in the info list are super safe
     or that they make kdump actually more safe.

  4. Create one more notifier list for operations that always should
     be called before crash_dump.

Regarding the extra notifier list (4th solution). It is not clear to
me whether it would be always called even before hypervisor list or
when kdump is not enabled. We must not over-engineer it.

2nd proposal looks like a good compromise. But maybe we could do
this change few releases later. The notifiers split is a big
change on its own.

Best Regards,
Petr
